# Instructions

The models provided here allows for multiple propeller and ballast configurations. They are compatible with the 4" watertight enclosure sold by <a href="https://www.bluerobotics.com/">BlueRobotics</a>. Propellers are compatible with Turnigy Aerodrive DST brushless motors (tested DST-700 and DST-1200, so far).
